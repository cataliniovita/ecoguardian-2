## Description
EcoGuardian is a community-powered environmental reporting app built with Flutter. It allows users to report environmental hazards like ragweed outbreaks, water pollution, illegal dumping, and noise pollution. The app maps these reports using GPS, making it easier to monitor, analyze, and take action.

Compared to similar apps, EcoGuardian combines photo documentation, offline capabilities vi a SQLite, and an interactive statistics dashboard in one clean package. While existing platforms (like local government portals or dedicated apps for air quality) offer fragmented solutions, EcoGuardian delivers a unified approach.
